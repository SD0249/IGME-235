# Project Ideas Brainstorm 
***********************************************
## Project 1 [One-Page Website]
- Probably would be a personalized portfolio. <br />
***********************************************
## Project 2 [Web Service Application]
- Search Engine? Idk what search stuff I would do, but maybe HTTYD or WOF search engine for Chloe?<br/ >
***********************************************
## Project 3 [Interactive Game/Experience]
- Since I like Physics and I wouldn't mind working at a med sim or other VR/AR simulation or any other simulation stuff, so maybe a physics simulator? <br/ >
- I was thinking of doing heart sim, but I think this will be too hard to simulate in a webpage XD <br/ >
- Something with interesting concept not in other physics simulations would be cool. A interactive webpage!
