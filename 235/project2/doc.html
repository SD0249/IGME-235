            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Trivia Quest is a web-based quiz application that fetches questions dynamically from the OpenTrivia
                Database API.
                Users can filter questions by category, difficulty, and type. The application tracks scores and
                performance metrics,
                including time taken per correct question and average times by category.

            <h2>Development Process</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Planned structure and UI layout using HTML5 semantic elements and CSS Grid/Flexbox</li>
                <li>Integrated OpenTrivia API using fetch(), handled errors like 429, displayed information returned
                </li>
                <li>Implemented local storage for saving user preferences and average time taken by each category</li>
                <li>Added timer for questions, score tracking, and strongest/weakest category display based on average
                    time of each category</li>
                <li>Tested responsiveness on mobile sizes</li>
            </ol>

                    <p>
                        After getting feedback in class and after submitting a proposal for Project 3, I asked
                        ChatGPT to access my prototype based off from the rubric, and I think this vastly increased my
                        workflow because I got a better idea of what I should improve.

            <h2>Self-Assessment</h2>
            <p>
                Based on the rubric, I believe this project meets the functional, and code quality requirements, but
                weak in design to some degree.
                I would grade this project as <strong>A-B</strong>.
