        <p>I ended up choosing Idea 1 because the limitation of time, and also I just thought 2 might be uncomfortable in a way that users can't get to the project directly.</p>

        <p>I had to look through the book a lot because I didn't remember all of the attributes for the CSS elements.</p>

        <h2>- Goal for my site</h2>
        <p>My goal is to show the relation of the projects that create my portfolio, so the employers get to know me better as a person! My design choice was to make it clean but catchy.</p>

        <h2>- Notes</h2>
        <h3>Phase 1</h3>
        <p>I am not really sure if I went above and beyond for Phase 1, because it just took so much time trying to adjust the placement of each element, and how I implemented footsteps wasn't pretty easy, so I had to mess around with a lot of attributes. I think the challenging part is since I learn more as I do this, I feel like I could have made a better design choice if I were the version of me that completed Phase 1, but I think I can do better in Phase 2.</p>
        <h3>Phase 2</h3>
        <p>I'm satisfied with what I did, but I definitely feel like the responsive design would have been much better with a grid, because I spent too much time perhaps to work on the flex box, margin, padding, and alignment. The footstep title in responsive design, its align changes by the screen size, and in the Biography box, my name in bold acts like a block element, even though I have its attribute changed to inline. Besides that, I tried my best with the navigation bar, including feedbacks to give more comfortable spacing, and sizing up the images compared to spec. Also doing the animation for the hamburger to x was pretty fun. Also doing layering with the navigation bar and the span elements to have a background image was hard but valuable. I would really appreciate any feedback, because I am willing to update this!</p>
