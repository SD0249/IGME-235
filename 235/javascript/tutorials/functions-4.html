        // Both functions and variables that are declared using either 'let' or 'const', are SCOPED to the current BLOCK
        // -> 'Block' -> Delimited by a pair of {} and used to group statements
        // -> 'Scope' -> Where your variable is accessible and modifiable in your program
        // *Outside the Block? -> Script Scope

        // There are many GLOBALLY scoped objects - alerts, arrays, the Math Object, and so on
        // Functions we created at the top level with the function keyword are also in the GLOBAL scope
        // Our scripts have FULL access to these and other GLOBAL variables

        // Variables declared with the var keyword are scoped to the NEAREST enclosing function 
        // in which they were declared, they are NOT BLOCK SCOPED
        // If a variable is declared with the var keyword OUTSIDE of a function, that variable is now in the GLOBAL scope

        // ** Hoisting: Where variable and function declarations are conceptually 
        //              moved to the TOP of their containing scope during the compilation phase
        // ! var declarations are hoisted and initialized to undefined, while let and const declarations 
        //   are hoisted but remain uninitialized, leading to the temporal dead zone and ReferenceError if accessed before declaration
