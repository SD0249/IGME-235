        <h2>- Goal for my site</h2>
        <p>My goal is to show the relation of the projects that create my portfolio, so the employers get to know me better as a person! My design choice was to make it clean but catchy.</p>

        <h2>- Notes</h2>
        <h3>Phase 1</h3>
        <p>I am not really sure if I went above and beyond for Phase 1, because it just took so much time trying to adjust the placement of each element, and how I implemented footsteps wasn't pretty easy, so I had to mess around with a lot of attributes. I think the challenging part is since I learn more as I do this, I feel like I could have made a better design choice if I were the version of me that completed Phase 1, but I think I can do better in Phase 2.</p>
        <h3>Phase 2</h3>
